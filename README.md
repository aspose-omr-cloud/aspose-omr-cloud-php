# PHP REST API for OMR Processing
[Aspose.OMR for Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/omr/) is a REST API that helps you to perform optical mark recognition in the cloud. We provide a series of [SDKs](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud). Along with that, you can get [binaries](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-dotnet/releases) to start working immediately and recognize various OMR forms.

Developers can embed [optical recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_mark_recognition) in any type of application to extract data from images of tests, exams, questionnaires, surveys, etc. In the repository you can find examples on how to start using [Aspose.OMR API](https://docs.aspose.cloud/omr/omr-api-specification/) in your project.

## OMR Processing Features

- Perform recognition of scanned photos and images for OMR operations.
- Ability to perform OMR on rotated & perspective (within 25 deg) photos.
- Extract & recognize human-marked data from scanned tests, exams, surveys, etc.
- Supports the export of OMR results to CSV file format.
- Use textual markup to generate OMR templates, generate surveys, and test sheets.
- Availability of GUI application for managing OMR templates.
- Specify the number of OMR based questions & answers in the template.
- Availability of GUI OMR editor as a cloud client.
- Provide JSON rules to perform OMR answer grading.
- Clip an area of interest from an image, save it as JPEG & perform OMR on it.
- Perform highly accurate optical mark recognition (OMR).

## Save OMR As
CSV

## Read OMR Formats
JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, PDF
## Quickstart

You can perform tasks out of the box without writing a single line of code with our [GUI client](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-dotnet/releases). You can also refer to the [client documentation](https://docs.aspose.cloud/omr/aspose-omr-client-application/).

## Using OMR Cloud API in your Php projects

This PHP package is automatically generated by the [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project:

- API version: 1.1
- Build package: io.swagger.codegen.languages.PhpClientCodegen

## Requirements

PHP 5.6 and later

**PHP 5.6/Windows:**
 - Please make sure that local repository path and all paths of all required packages do not exceed maximum length of a path (usually 255 symbols).
 - Aspose.OMR for Cloud use [Guzzle](http://guzzle3.readthedocs.io/getting-started/overview.html) library to perform REST requests. [Guzzle](http://guzzle3.readthedocs.io/getting-started/overview.html) framework uses cURL (libcurl) as transport library. On windows platform you can face problems with accessing **https** resources depending on libcurl version you are using.
   * If you are using libcurl built with OpenSSL, you need to download [CA Certificates](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html) and update your php.ini:
   ```
   ....
   [curl]
   curl.cainfo="<full path to cacert.pem file>"
   [openssl]
   openssl.cafile="<full path to cacert.pem file>"
   ...
   ```
   * If you are using libcurl built with WinSSL, you are ready to go becuase WinSSL uses windows certificates store

OpenSSL and WinSSL based libcurl versions can be downloaded from [here](https://curl.haxx.se/gknw.net/7.40.0/). Just choose your platform (x86 or x64) and OpenSSL (look for `ssl` string in the file name) or WinSSL (look for `winssl` string in the file name)

## Installation



### Clone repository

Clone `aspose-omr-cloud` **with submodules**:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-php.git --recurse-submodules
```


### Composer

To install the bindings via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), add the following to `composer.json`:

```
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "git",
      "url": "https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-php.git"
    }
  ],
  "require": {
    "aspose/aspose-omr-cloud": "*@dev"
  }
}
```

Then run `composer install`

### Manual Installation

Download the files and include `autoload.php`:

```php
    require_once('/path/to/Aspose.OMR for Cloud/vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Optional requirements

To take full advantage of Aspose.OMR for Cloud, _aspose/storage-sdk-php_ is required. You may refer to official [Aspose Storage SDK](https://github.com/aspose-storage-cloud/aspose-storage-cloud-php) to get more information.

## Usage

### Receive Cloud Keys
Aspose.Cloud credentials are required to use Aspose.OMR for Cloud API. You can acquire App SID and App Key by registrating at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud). It will take only a couple of minutes.


### Update submodule
Make sure you've cloned [aspose-omr-cloud-demo-data](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-demo-data) submodule, that contains all data required to run demo.
In case you are missing submodules use the following git commands to initialize and update them:
```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote --merge
```


### Code example
You can check out [OMR Demo](demo) project to get started with Aspose.OMR for Cloud.
