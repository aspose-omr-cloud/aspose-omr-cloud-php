# Aspose.OMR for Cloud

[Aspose.OMR for Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/omr/) is a REST API that helps you to perform optical mark recognition in the cloud. We provide a series of [SDKs](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud). Along with that, you can get [binaries](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-dotnet/releases) to start working immediately and recognize various OMR forms.

Developers can embed [optical recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_mark_recognition) in any type of application to extract data from images of tests, exams, questionnaires, surveys, etc. In the repository you can find examples on how to start using [Aspose.OMR API](https://docs.aspose.cloud/omr/omr-api-specification/) in your project.

## Quickstart

You can perform tasks out of the box without writing a single line of code with our [GUI client](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-dotnet/releases). You can also refer to the [client documentation](https://docs.aspose.cloud/omr/aspose-omr-client-application/).

## Using OMR Cloud API in your Php projects

This PHP package is automatically generated by the [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project:

- API version: 1.1
- Build package: io.swagger.codegen.languages.PhpClientCodegen

## Requirements

PHP 5.6 and later

**PHP 5.6/Windows:** 
 - Please make sure that local repository path and all paths of all required packages do not exceed maximum length of a path (usually 255 symbols).
 - Aspose.OMR for Cloud use [Guzzle](http://guzzle3.readthedocs.io/getting-started/overview.html) library to perform REST requests. [Guzzle](http://guzzle3.readthedocs.io/getting-started/overview.html) framework uses cURL (libcurl) as transport library. On windows platform you can face problems with accessing **https** resources depending on libcurl version you are using.
   * If you are using libcurl built with OpenSSL, you need to download [CA Certificates](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html) and update your php.ini:
   ```
   ....
   [curl]
   curl.cainfo="<full path to cacert.pem file>"
   [openssl]
   openssl.cafile="<full path to cacert.pem file>"
   ...
   ```
   * If you are using libcurl built with WinSSL, you are ready to go becuase WinSSL uses windows certificates store
   
OpenSSL and WinSSL based libcurl versions can be downloaded from [here](https://curl.haxx.se/gknw.net/7.40.0/). Just choose your platform (x86 or x64) and OpenSSL (look for `ssl` string in the file name) or WinSSL (look for `winssl` string in the file name)
 
## Installation



### Clone repository

Clone `aspose-omr-cloud` **with submodules**:
```sh
